The images were captured in black and white, but for each plate there were three images. The top image of each plate was taken with a blue filter covering the lens, so it represents the "blue" channel of the image. Likewise, the middle image is the green channel and the bottom image is the red channel. This assignment uses image processing techniques to align and combine these three channels to form a color image. </p></td>

                        <td><p>The goal of this project was to create an animated morph between two faces. This is accomplished by first defining corresponding points between the two face images. Then, the average of these points are taken, this is the average face shape, and triangulated. This triangulation is then used to create affine transform matrices between each face and the average face. To generate a frame in a morphing sequence, the points in each triangle are transformed to corresponding locations in an output image. The color at each point is determined from a weighted average (based on frame number) of the colors in the input faces. The shape at each step in the morph is determined by the same weighted average of the input faces. To define the corresponding points, Matlab's cpselect tool was used.

                                         <td><p>In the vertigo shot project, the goal was to duplicate the dolly zoom in-camera effect. It is called a "Vertigo shot" since it was popularized in Hitchcock's movie Vertigo. To create the effect, I took multiple pictures of a subject while changing the camera's location and focal length. I used a Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens on a Canon Digital Rebel XT to capture the images. In the fake miniatures project, the goal is to take images of real scenes and make them look as if they are miniature toy versions. This is done by defining a focus line and then creating the depth of field to be a few pixels around that. Outside of that area, the image gets progressively more blurry through Gaussian filters. To improve the effect, the in focus part of the image becomes more saturated.
